# Object Enhancements

## src/objectenhancements.ts

```ts
let color = "red";
let speed = 10;
function go() {
    console.log("Vroom");
}

let car = {color, speed, go};

console.log(car);
car.go();

let modifiedCar = {
    color,
    speed,
    go() {
        console.log("Furious Vroom");
    }
};

console.log(modifiedCar);
modifiedCar.go();
```

## Challenge

Check passing ["go"] as the name of the function attribute in object definition which is called as a computed property in ES6 not allowed in TS
